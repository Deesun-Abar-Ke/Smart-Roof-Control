# Smart-Roof-Control
The Smart Roof Control System is an intricately planned, cutting-edge,
Arduino-based project that automates the rain protection of outdoor clothing
and facilitates the effective use of collected rainwater for plant irrigation. This
sophisticated system expertly integrates a rain sensor, servo motor, and
submersible pump, creating a multifunctional solution that is both clever and
responsive. At its core, the rain sensor continuously monitors for precipitation,
sending immediate signals to the Arduino microcontroller upon detecting
raindrops. The microcontroller then swiftly activates the servo motor, which
operates a retractable roof mechanism to cover and protect clothes from getting
wet. Concurrently, rainwater is efficiently collected in a storage reservoir,
ready to be repurposed for irrigation. The submersible pump, controlled by the
Arduino via a relay module, draws water from the reservoir and delivers it to
plants, ensuring they receive adequate moisture. This environmentally
responsible approach not only enhances convenience but also promotes
sustainability by maximizing the utility of natural rainwater resources.
Through its seamless integration of technology, the Smart Roof Control
System exemplifies an intelligent and eco-friendly solution, improving both
everyday life and environmental stewardship.
